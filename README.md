# 42Hive-Libft
# A reproduction of the C library by Hive Students

*The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that will be used in all 42 (Hive) projects*

This is the first real project by Hive students in their training towards a software engineering career.

Given many of the usual C library functions are forbidden by the 42 school curriculum, we re-code many of these fundamental functions. These student made functions can be reused in our C projects in the future. As we recreate these lines of code from the C library, students gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of C.
